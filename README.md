## Hello and welcome everybody ðŸ‘‹
### Short Introduction
I am Sara and I am currently studying to become a web programmer. I will update this profile as I improve my programming skills!
I have a background as a certified healthcare assistant. ðŸ©º I have always had a strong interest in helping others and providing care, but at the same time, I am passionate about everything related to **design** and **digital art**.
