## Hello and welcome everybody ðŸ‘‹
###  Introduction
I am Sara and I am currently studying to become a web programmer. I will update this profile as I improve my programming skills!
I have a background as a certified healthcare assistant. I have always had a strong interest in helping others and providing care, but at the same time, I am passionate about everything related to **design** and **digital art**. I recently discovered my passion for **web development**, and it has been an exciting journey so far! The idea of me to build creative, functional websites and bringing ideas to life is a goal I hopefully want to achieve in the future. As I explore **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I'm constantly learning new techniques and tools to improve my skills. I'm eager to continue growing as a web developer and dive deeper into front-end and back-end technologies. 

### My Interest
- Digital art and illustrations
- Digital software using tools like Inkscape, and Procreate, and I have some basic knowledge of Photoshop.
* Also still learning and exploring UI/UX design to understand how to create user-friendly interfaces
